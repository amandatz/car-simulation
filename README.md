# Car simulation
Car simulaion made with Arduino.

## Usage
There are two potentiometers, one that controls the direction and the other the speed. The first, responsible for steering, moves the micro servo (steering wheel). The second controls the two DC motors. There is also a key to turn the car on/off.
